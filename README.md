# Motor Torque Curve Editor

A desktop application for creating and editing motor torque curves stored in JSON files.

## Features

### Phase 1 (Current - Foundation)
- ✅ Create new motor definition files
- ✅ Load and save motor curve data in JSON format
- ✅ Hierarchical data structure: Motor → Drive(s) → Voltage(s) → Curve Series
- ✅ Data models for motor definitions, drive configurations, voltage configurations, curve series, and data points
- ✅ Curve generation from motor parameters (max speed, torque, power)
- ✅ 1% increment data storage (101 points per curve)
- ✅ Basic UI shell with menu bar
- ✅ Structured logging with Serilog
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests (138 tests)

### Future Phases
- Phase 2: Interactive chart with LiveCharts2
- Phase 3: Directory browser and save prompts
- Phase 4: EQ-style curve editing with Q slider
- Phase 5: User preferences and settings
- Phase 6: Units system (Nm ↔ lbf-in)
- Phase 7: Tabbed interface for multiple files
- Phase 8: Power curve overlay

## Getting Started

## Data Format

Motor definitions are stored as JSON files with a hierarchical structure:

**Motor → Drive(s) → Voltage(s) → Curve Series**

This structure reflects the real-world relationship where:
- A motor can be paired with multiple drives
- Each drive can operate at multiple voltages
- Each voltage configuration has its own performance characteristics and curve series
- Motor base properties (theoretical maximums from cut sheet) are stored at the motor level to avoid data duplication
