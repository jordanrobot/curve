See ADR-0009 (`../../docs/adr/adr-0009-logging-and-error-handling-policy.md`) for the logging and error handling policy.

### 1.8 Undo/Redo Infrastructure
- [x] Implement IUndoableCommand interface
- [x] Create UndoStack service for managing per-document edit history and exposing CanUndo/CanRedo and UndoDepth
- [x] Define command classes for common operations with reliable Execute/Undo semantics and logging on failure:
  - EditPointCommand
  - EditSeriesCommand
  - EditMotorPropertyCommand
- [x] Wire Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y keyboard shortcuts
- [x] Integrate undo/redo with dirty state tracking, including a clean checkpoint tied to saves so undoing back to the saved state clears the dirty flag

See ADR-0003 (`../../docs/adr/adr-0003-motor-property-undo-design.md`) for the generalized undo/redo command pattern applied across motor, drive, voltage, chart, and curve data edits.

**Note on Motor, Drive, and Voltage Properties:**

Motor-level text properties (e.g., Motor Name, Manufacturer, Part Number) are wired through explicit view-model edit methods and `EditMotorPropertyCommand` instances that store old and new values up front. The motor text boxes bind to simple editor properties (e.g., `MotorNameEditor`) and commit changes via these methods on focus loss, with `TextBox`-local undo disabled. Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y are handled at the window level and operate on the shared per-document `UndoStack`, so motor property edits participate in the same undo/redo history as chart and grid edits. Drive and selected-voltage properties (scalars and series-related) follow the same pattern using `EditDrivePropertyCommand` and `EditVoltagePropertyCommand`, plus editor buffers such as `DriveNameEditor`, `VoltagePowerEditor`, and `VoltagePeakTorqueEditor`. TextBoxes bind to these editor properties with `IsUndoEnabled = false` and commit on LostFocus via view-model methods (e.g., `EditDriveName`, `EditSelectedVoltagePower`) that push commands onto the shared `UndoStack`. See ADR-0003 (`../../docs/adr/adr-0003-motor-property-undo-design.md`) for the finalized design and rationale.

On undo/redo, the main view model calls back into a central refresh method (e.g., `RefreshMotorEditorsFromCurrentMotor`) and then refreshes the chart and data table so that all property textboxes, the chart axes, and the grid stay synchronized with the current undo state.

**Future Refinements Using ADR-0003 and ADR-000X Patterns:**

To keep the codebase cohesive and efficient, a future agent should consider how the command-driven edit patterns from ADR-0003 and ADR-000X can be applied more broadly:

- **Motor and drive scalar properties:** Route all edits (name, manufacturer, part number, numeric specs) through explicit view-model edit methods that create undoable commands, instead of direct two-way bindings to domain models.
- **Additional configuration panels:** When adding new groups of scalar properties (e.g., future drive metadata, per-series configuration), add editor buffers, an `Edit*PropertyCommand`, and LostFocus commit methods that push commands and refresh dependent views.
- **Curve data table and chart edits:** Ensure grid cell edits and (future) chart drag edits both go through shared edit methods (e.g., `EditPointTorque`) that push `EditPointCommand`s, rather than letting the UI mutate `DataPoint` instances directly.
- **Selection and coordination logic:** Centralize selection changes (from chart and table) through coordinator/view-model APIs that record origin and avoid feedback loops, making it easier to reason about and test selection behavior.

These refinements should be evaluated against the current codebase when planning advanced editing work (Phase 4) so that undo/redo behavior, selection coordination, and mutation paths remain consistent and maintainable.

**Deliverable:** Application that can create, open, and save motor files with JSON content display. Includes full undo/redo support and structured logging.

- [ ] If the user chooses to adjust series data format within the json schema, implement this change.

**Deliverable:** Application with working multi-series chart, series visibility toggles, and editable data grid.

## Phase 3: File Management


### 3.0 Generic Panel Expand/Collapse
- [ ] Implement generic expand/collapse mechanism for existing panels. Use relevant ADRs as reference, but do not be constrained by these ADRs as this functionality is not yet implemented. If we need to adjust ADRs to better fit the implementation, we can do so, please just let me know.
  - [ ] Implement new panel system to meet the functional requirements detailed in `Phase 3.0 Functional Requirements: Generic Panel Expand/Collapse` in `.github/planning/phase-3-0-requirements.md`
  - [ ] Add vertical Panel Bar with rotated text labels to control expansion/collapse
  - [ ] Ensure Panel Bar labels are text-only (no icons/glyphs) and use exact strings:
    - [ ] Motor Properties = "Properties"
    - [ ] Curve Data = "Data"
    - [ ] Directory Browser = "Browser"
  - [ ] Ensure Panel Bar background color matches panel header background
  - [ ] Convert existing panels to use the new expand/collapse mechanism, but convert the panels one-at-a-time to ensure stability. Order:
  - [ ] Directory Browser (empty panel, contents will be be implemented in Phase 3.1)
  - [ ] Motor Properties
  - [ ] Curve Data
  - [ ] Curve Graph
  - [ ] Locate Curve Data panel in the left zone (remove it from the bottom zone)
  - [ ] Ensure expanding a panel collapses only panels in the same zone (panels in other zones stay expanded)
  - [ ] Disable a zone's resize splitter when that zone has no expanded panel
  - [ ] Enable and apply splitters normally when the zone has an expanded panel
  - [ ] Default panel states (first run / no persisted state):
    - [ ] Directory Browser expanded
    - [ ] Motor Properties expanded
    - [ ] Curve Data collapsed
  - Note: after each conversion, we will do a full round of UI/Ux testing to ensure nothing is broken.


### 3.0.5 VS Code UI Styling Pass
- [ ] Adjust main-window UI colors and styling to match the screenshot in `.github/planning/vs-code-ui.png`.
- [ ] Centralize VS Code-like styling into CurveEditor theme resources and reference them via `DynamicResource`.

- [X] Save command overwrites current file
- [X] Save As: save to new file, new file becomes active
- [X] Save Copy As: save copy to new file, original stays active
- [X] All saves overwrite (no append mode)

**Deliverable:** Full file management with directory browser and save prompts.

## Phase 4: Advanced Editing

### 4.0 Series Data Adjustment
- [ ] Transpose the series data so that each series is represented as a row instead of a column

- [ ] Sync dragged torque changes back to the data model in real-time

### 4.2 Q Value Control

  - High Q = gradual changes (affects more adjacent points)
- [ ] Visual indication of affected zone when dragging
- [ ] Q value persists during editing session

### 4.3 Background Image Overlay
- [ ] Add "Load Background Image" menu/button

- [ ] Keep selection semantics (replace, extend, toggle) consistent between chart and table

See ADR-0008 (`../../docs/adr/adr-0008-selection-and-editing-coordination.md`) for the detailed selection coordination design.

**Deliverable:** Fully functional MVP with EQ-style editing and image overlay.
